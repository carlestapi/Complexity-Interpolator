# Complexity-Interpolator

Complexity Based AI Sound Synthesis and Musical Score Interpolator

The overall scope of our musical system is to be able to produce and explore a new set of sounds
and musical scores according to a predefined complexity parameter via two kinds of AI hidden and
latent space interpolation algorithms.
